# Concurrency-Project

automated e-commerce center that handles online orders for a major shopping platform. The purpose of this assignment is to simulate the daily operations of the center by processing 600 online orders with the use of concurrency techniques. The concurrent activities are handles through multi-threading and proper synchronization mechanisms such as multithreading to represent real world parallel activities such as order intake, packing, labelling, sorting, loading and truck dispatching. To ensure the data consistency and safe access to shared resources, appropriate synchronization mechanisms such as locks, atomic variables and thread safe queues are implemented throughout the system. The project aims to demonstrate real-world functions throughout the system by implementing effectiveness of concurrent execution as well as simulation of delays such as machines breaking down or labelling errors.
